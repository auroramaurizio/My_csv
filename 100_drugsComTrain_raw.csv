95260,Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. 
We have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective.""",8,27-Apr-10,192
92703,Lybrel,Birth Control,"""I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.
The positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.""",5,14-Dec-09,17

The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control.

I feel healthier, I&#039;m excelling at my job and I always have money in my pocket and my savings account.  I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&#039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing. The cost pales in comparison to what I spent on oxycontin.""",9,27-Nov-16,37

My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily.

It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&#039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today.

Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I&#039;m sure it would not have been safe.

Have recently had a bad flare and narrowing at the anastomosis and need to be on medication, but haven&#039;t found one that I can handle.

Helped tremendously with the cough but then I was having bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. I hadn&#039;t eaten anything that should have upset my stomach and it didn&#039;t really feel like a &quot;bug&quot; so I looked up side effects for Delsym.

I&#039;ve never had acne problems in my life, and immediately broke out after getting it implanted. Sex drive is completely gone, and I used to have sex with my boyfriend a few days a week, now its completely forced and not even fun for me anymore. I mean I&#039;m on birth control because I like having sex but don&#039;t want to get pregnant, why take a birth control that takes away sex?

It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don&#039;t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.  When this started I could barely walk the length of myself without getting winded - I have lost 58 lbs so far.""",9,19-Jan-17,20

Unfortunately once the tablets finished the infection returned so needed a 2nd course. I&#039;m currently taking a low dose at evening to keep the infection at bay while the specialists do some tests.  I normally get every side effect going and dread taking new medication in any form especially after an horrific experience with Ciorofloxacin but the only side effect I experienced with this was itchy ankles and feet on day two but that didn&#039;t last into third day so I would class this as a minor side effect and insignificant.

I tried cymbalta for a week and my Dr decided that since it kept me awake 24/7 that it wasn&#039;t a good fit for me even though it relieved my pain. I started with 25 mg. After 2 weeks I had some breakthrough pain, so my Dr increased my dosage to 50mg and I&#039;m still on that dosage today. For the first full year I was on this I never had pain and felt &#039;cured&#039;. As time went on, it seems to help control my pain. I do still have pain, but at a low manageable level.

Within a few days of starting Lamictal (was on Tegretol) it was as if someone had turned a light on in my head. Is this the way &quot;normal&quot; people think? was one of the first things that struck me. I sleep like a log, have no irritability, almost no anger (other than what would be considered normal). I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It&#039;s a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted.

He told me that was a good medication for insomnia. He put me on 25 mgs, but stated I may have to figure out what dosage is best for me.

The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework.

I went to the ER and when I finally got in they put me on an IV to hydrate me. They then added Imitrex to the bag and I soon started feeling side effects. My head felt like I was going to pass out.

102449,Aripiprazole,Schizophrenia,"""Abilify 20 mg.
I am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don&#039;t feel out of the normal with any &quot;sexual frustration&quot;...and I wouldn&#039;t say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn&#039;t have &quot;mental illness&quot;, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.
Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, &quot;This medication is working for you&quot;.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. 
My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  
I don&#039;t know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.  Overall, since this medication has not been threatening to me, I feel I should embrace it.""",10,25-Sep-16,26
60455,Pyridium,Dysuria,"""I&#039;ve been having UTIs for 7 years, my most recent one has lasted 24 days so far. Because of this I went to the doctor and they prescribed me pyridium twice a day. I was very hopeful but unfortunately it didn&#039;t work. The burning while urinating is still there and I&#039;ve been on it for three days so far. Also discomfort all hours of the day down there. It may work well for others but my body doesn&#039;t accept it, it did nothing. Going to the doctor was useless, go straight to the urologist""",1,13-Oct-16,8
87285,Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have had great experience so far with Latuda. I started taking 40 mg in Nov., and it worked great for about a week, then I crashed again. Dr. put it up to 80 mg and I&#039;ve been great ever since. I&#039;m afraid, though, because my sex drive has completely disappeared, and if it&#039;s the Latuda, I&#039;m going to have to go off it-and I hate to go off something that&#039;s working so well. However, I&#039;m also on a pretty high dose of Lexapro, and the Dr. thinks it&#039;s more likely to be a side effect of that, so we&#039;re decreasing that and hopefully that will work, because otherwise I&#039;m feeling really good. I&#039;m really afraid I&#039;ll have to go off it.""",8,20-Feb-12,39

106703,Implanon,Birth Control,"""Never again! After being on depo I was suppose to b an ideal candidate the first 6 months was ok bit moody but fine no weight gain but then something changed I was constantly bleeding and getting horrible hormone spots I normally have clear skin mood swings were increasing. After 14 months I decided to have it taken out and that was an ordeal they can b very tricky for the doc remove. So 3 anesthetics and a few stitches later its out. It&#039;s simply not worth the hassle""",2,20-Aug-15,1
131704,Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""Was on this med for 5 years. Worked fine but not great. Stopped the panic attacks and gave me relief of every day nervousness that I was experiencing. Took months for the side effects to diminish when I first started taking it. What did not leave - insomnia, night sweats, lack of sex drive and poor orgasms (or no orgasms at all).""",6,27-Dec-16,23
192806,Drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol,Birth Control,"""I was put on Yasmin for 6 months to regulate my cycle and reduce acne flare-ups and it was the worst 6 months of my life. I gained 20lbs that did NOT come off easily after stopping the pill, experienced horrible mood swings, had HEAVIER periods, acne breakouts, breakthrough bleeding, and I was nauseous all the time. This pill seems to agree with most people but it definitely did not agree with me. I went on Femcon a year after stopping Yasmin and experienced virtually no side effects.""",3,11-Apr-11,8
69488,Buprenorphine,Pain,"""I love my Butrans patch!!! And it has relieved more than half of my pain, and I know this because I only have to take less than half of my pain killers now that I am on the patch! I change my patch every Saturday, but if I miss 24 hours my pain starts to reside again. If you are not a heavy drinker I would advise trying this patch!!!""",10,6-Aug-15,47
107449,Implanon,Birth Control,"""I have been on this for 8 months and sad to say it&#039;s caused nothing but my self esteem to become lower. I&#039;ve gained 10 lbs out of no where. I&#039;m only 22 and have a fast metabolism. I thought it started to slow down but it didn&#039;t make sense. My breasts got smaller, I have lost complete sex drive, my breasts aren&#039;t sensitive anymore at all like they used to be and I&#039;m so emotional, even crying at times. The only thing I can say is that it is 100% effective but not worth what it has done to my body. Not only that but I started breaking out on my body and on my face as well.""",1,1-Sep-11,2
60156,NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I was off birth control for a while considering getting pregnant. I had used other types of birth control before, the pill, the patch, etc. I decided to get back on birth control but didn&#039;t want to worry about taking a daily pill so I requested the Nuvaring. When I started the Nuvaring I felt it inside my body and had a lot of cramps. A few days later I started experiencing more cramps and very strong upper stomach pain. They were so bad I missed work for a week. Finally I ended up going to the ER and they couldn&#039;t figure out what was wrong. I finally asked the doctor and it was the Nuvaring side effects.""",5,18-Apr-13,9
88659,Prepopik,Bowel Preparation,"""I took the Prepopik for my first colonoscopy (I&#039;m 25) and I found it to be very effective. The orange flavor was very tolerable. I had no bad cramps or terrible side effects with it, but I had taken magnesium citrate the night before and that had already cleaned me out somewhat. My only issue was I ended up so dehydrated that I showed up to my colonoscopy with a fever. Try to drink as much fluid as you can with this prep! I drank plenty, but there was more liquid coming out of me than going in. Overall, I would recommend the Prepopik. On a side note, my insurance didn&#039;t cover it, but the office I go to had it available. I recommend asking your office if they have it available if insurance won&#039;t cover it at the pharmacy.""",9,14-Mar-15,6
24139,Tretinoin,Acne,"""I just hit my three month point on tretinoin .05% and I&#039;m so happy. I was really  depressed about my skin during the first two months because I&#039;ve never had bad acne and the cream made me have horrible acne. But I knew that was the worst part of it and after that was over I would be fine. I&#039;ve inly had two zits since then and I&#039;m only left with scars which is fine. Try it out even if you&#039;re scared because I was too and I&#039;m so glad i did. It&#039;s worth it!""",10,4-Nov-15,13
131909,Effexor XR,Depression,"""This medicine saved my life. I was at my wits end with anti-depressants and was ready to give up. My doctor finally prescribed me this after many failed medications, I am so glad she did. I honestly do not know where I would be without Effexor XR. Side effects were very mild compared to other anti-depressants I tried. I was drowsy for the first couple days, but it was tolerable. I highly recommend this for severe depression. I would also like to mention for people to realize there is light at the end of the tunnel and YOU WILL GET BETTER, and to never give up.""",10,20-Jun-13,166

85162,Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Acne,"""Best treatment for acne I have used! I&#039;ve gone through accutane, many face washes, retinol creams, and other forms of birth control. Some other forms of birth control just make acne worse, depending on the type of progestin in it. You need the least androgenic type possible, and sprintec has worked the best for me! Nearly clear skin. Takes about 5-6 months to fully work, but it does work.""",9,3-Nov-15,7

I had to use estrogen medicine also because my uterine lining was too thin. Then my doctor had me use HCG shot to stimulate ovulation since Clomid can apparently mess up if/when ovulation occurs. I took the HCG shot over 2 weeks ago. I noticed some weird symptoms a few days ago and I just took multiple pregnancy tests. And I&#039;m pregnant! So Clomid worked great for me so far.

My plastic surgeon wasn&#039;t familiar with treating OIC so I called my primary care physician. She gave me Amitiza 24mcg. It took almost two days but it was amazing and I was so thankful. I had to remain on opioids for three weeks and the Amitiza worked so well I haven&#039;t had any issues!! Thank you Amitiza!!!""",10,12-Jan-16,35
